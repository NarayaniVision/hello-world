# hello-world
My first steps to success.

Dreaming is my primary language, I only speak English in order to communicate with humans. 
I am here to learn how to speak to computers so that I may share my primary language with humans.
There seem to be many languages in technology, I would like to learn as many as possible.
So that these dreams can be expressed in the best ways possible.
